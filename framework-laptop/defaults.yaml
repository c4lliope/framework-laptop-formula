# The values seen here are the defaults provided to parametrized

framework-laptop:

  # Default mem sleep setting.
  # Tiger Lake supposedly lacks S3 support, yet the Framework
  # somehow manages to suspend to RAM. Still consider setting 
  # this to `s2idle`. In conjucntion with hibernate, it might make 
  # sense to go the Windows route of doing suspend then hibernate with
  # `s2idle`. Would provide fast suspend/resume and would limit
  # the amount of battery drain should the laptop be left
  # suspended for extended period of time.
  # Leaving as `deep` for now.
  mem_sleep_default: deep

  hibernate:
    # Valid modes are `hibernate`, `hybrid_sleep`, `suspend_then_hibernate`
    # `hibernate` doesn't do anything special after setting up `/swapfile`
    # and enabling hibernate. You could add a button in GNOME via an
    # extension to get a a hibernate item in your power menu. *Adding
    # such an item has not been tested.* Hibernating via
    # `systemctl hibernate` works fine. Setting the power button action to
    # Hibernate also works as expected.
    # The other two options function as described in the systemd manual:
    # https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-sleep.conf.html
    mode: suspend_then_hibernate
    suspend_then_hibernate:
      # Useful states are `mem` and `freeze`
      # `mem` means suspend to RAM or S3
      # `freeze` means suspend to idle or S2 
      # Since we're only going to spend `hibernate_delay_sec` suspended
      # using freeze to avoid suspend to RAM issues could be a worthy
      # tradeoff.
      #
      # NB: suspend_state interacts with mem_sleep_default.
      # If the values specified do not match, one will take
      # precedence. Limited testing shows it's mem_sleep_default.
      suspend_state: mem
      hibernate_delay_sec: 180min
  
  # The number of seconds the `grub-decrease-menu-timeout` state will
  # decrease the GRUB menu timeout to.
  grub_recordfail_timeout: "1"
